I'm Jeongho Ahn (안정호 in South Korea), a research fellow at Kyushu University in Fukuoka.
I received my Ph.D. in Information Science and Electrical Engineering from Kyushu University in 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Ryo Kurazume](https://robotics.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/).
My primary research interests lie in the technologies behind computer vision and robotics.
