I am a research fellow at Kyushu University, affiliated with the Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering and the Faculty of Engineering. I received my PhD from Kyushu University in 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Ryo Kurazume](https://robotics.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/). My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and robotics, particularly in 3D scene understanding and gait recognition.
